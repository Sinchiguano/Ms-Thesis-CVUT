So far, the pose estimation system deals with an isolated object, in the future, in order to test the pose estimation system in bin-picking scenarios, careful attention should be given to the steps of features descriptors and matching strategy. These two steps are fundamental keys for dealing with occlusion and clutter scenes which are normal to see in bin-picking scenarios.

The proposed methods were evaluated with two cameras. Unfortunately, a third camera (RealSense D415), more accurate, came to the laboratory a few days before submitting this thesis work. However, the author of this thesis managed to carry on a third experiment, where a small database of source cloud was generated, and the registration method was evaluated by calculated two metrics: fitness, which measures the overlapping area, and the Root Mean Square Error, which measures the standard deviation of the residuals. The results were satisfactory and acceptable for this type of task, even performing during the whole process of validation test better than the Astra camera. The validation system results can be seen in \ref{appendix......}. However, a more thorough evaluation should be given to this sensor for future application.
