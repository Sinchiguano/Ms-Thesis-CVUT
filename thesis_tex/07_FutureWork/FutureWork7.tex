To further enhancements for the pose estimation pipeline, a greater attenton could be suitable 3D object reconstruction  


The further enhancements by using the dense refinement, such as the ICP algorithm
would increase the detection rate, however, the experiments have shown that this would lead to a noticeable increase of the required detection time.




A greater attention could be paid to the proposed selection of the reference points in the scene. Selecting the reference points in interesting regions could increase the detection rate while keeping the number of reference points and consequently the time consumption low. The proposed method utilizing the shape index seems promising, however, better computation of the shape index which would be less susceptible to the noise in the image should be devised.
Another extension could be to utilize the colour of the object and to use it to prune the hypotheses based on the dominant object colour.
